# unison-lobby

I've decided to release this lobby I made about a year ago since it's been left unused (the project disbanded). The lobby itself is fully functional and dynamic, meaning it can (should) adjust to any amount of rooms available (pagination). There's also a fancy effect when you hover over a room, plus a few other cool features. Should you look at the code, you may notice that it's not fully finished. The design was made by airplanE, and I put it into effect.
